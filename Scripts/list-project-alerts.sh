# Description:
# This script uses WhiteSource's API to display (in the stdout) a list of
# vulnerabilities affecting the last scanned project(s).
# It is intended to be executed from the scan's working directory, either
# independently or following a Unified Agent scan.

# Prerequisites:
# apt install jq curl
# WS_GENERATEPROJECTDETAILSJSON: true
# WS_USERKEY (admin assignment is required)
# WS_WSS_URL

# Known Limitations:
# The API response will be filtered by default based on the .cvss3_severity
# property. If a given vulnerability alert does not have a CVSS3 severity (i.e.
# the .vulnerability.cvss3_severity property is blank), that alert will not be
# included in the results. To use CVSS2 for filtering, change the jq condition
# below from `.vulnerability.cvss3_severity` to `.vulnerability.severity`.
# Note that when doing so, however, while the alert count will be accurate,
# some alerts might display a different severity than in the UI.
